Week 4: Testing and Metrics

Here's my update for Week 4. This week, my main goal was to validate my results. Visuals are subjective, so I built a "Comparison Tool" to generate hard numbers that proves the AI model is superior.

What I Did

Analysis Script: I created a new script called analysis.py. It takes two videos (original and upscaled), syncs them, and compares them with frame-by-frame.

Implemented Metrics: I wrote code to calculate three specific scores:

PSNR: Checks pixel accuracy.

SSIM: Checks if the structure/shapes are preserved.

LPIPS: A "perceptual" metric that uses a neural network to judge how the image looks to a human eye.

Visualizations: I used Matplotlib to generate "Difference Maps"—heatmaps that show exactly which pixels the AI changed compared to the original.

Results The numbers confirmed my hypothesis. The Real-ESRGAN model achieved a PSNR of 35.71 dB (which is considered excellent) and a very low LPIPS score of 0.06, meaning it looks very natural.

Traditional metrics like PSNR sometimes penalize AI because it "hallucinates" details, but LPIPS confirms that those hallucinations actually look good to humans.

Next Week For Week 5, I will wrap everything up. I'll do a final 3-way comparison (Original vs. Lanczos vs. AI) and record the final demo video for submission.
