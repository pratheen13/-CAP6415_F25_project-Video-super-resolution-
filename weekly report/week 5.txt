Week 5: Final Comparison and Demo

Here's my update for Week 5. This week, my main goal was to finalize the project. I conducted a final A/B test and recorded the demonstration video to show off the results.

What I Did

Final A/B Test: I updated my analysis tool to compare three things at once: The Reference Video, the Week 2 Baseline (Lanczos), and the Week 3 AI Model. This gave me a direct comparison table.

Demo Recording: I recorded a screen capture of the entire project. I showed:

The code running on Google Colab (showing the GPU usage).

The real-time metric calculation.

A side-by-side video playback showing the "blur vs. sharp" difference.

Documentation: I finalized the README.md and organized the repo so anyone can download and run it.

Results The final data showed that the AI model improved the signal quality by over +4 dB compared to the baseline and reduced the perceptual error by nearly 75%. The project is now fully complete and documented.
